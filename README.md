# ConvNet-C-CUDA
## Goal
This project aims to implement Convolutional Neural Networks in both C and CUDA, as well as compare their difference in performance.
### Note
The code used for the C implementation is an extension of my previous project [NeuralNet-C](https://github.com/AndyKocak/NeuralNet-C) which I reccomend you to look at before continuing.
